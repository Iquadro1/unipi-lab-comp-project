    "## Problem Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "The main issues in the current Witness Complex code are:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Missing Error Handling**\n",
    "- The code removed the `try-except` block that was protecting against failures\n",
    "- If the complex creation fails for any sample, the entire process crashes\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Incomplete Persistence Lists**\n",
    "- If any sample fails to process, the persistence lists (pl0, pl1, pl2) will have different lengths\n",
    "- This causes errors when computing bottleneck distances later\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Potential Parameter Issues**\n",
    "- `max_alpha_value` might still be too restrictive for some datasets\n",
    "- The witness complex might produce empty or very sparse results\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Missing Validation**\n",
    "- No check if the complex actually contains meaningful simplices\n",
    "- No validation that persistence intervals were successfully computed\n",
